# mySQLTest (Personal Computer Wishlist)
This personal computer wishlist was created as a demostration of MySQL and Object relational mapping. This websites allows a user to input their desired computer part and add it into a wishlist. The aim is to create a ease-of-use list to organize a grocery list of computer parts. There are both sections that were created to distinguish a products status on the wishlist which is "Purchased" and "Current Build Wishlist".
